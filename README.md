Project Management Plan 
Version 1

Executive Summary 
Team Alpha will be building a web application to maintain inventory of a t-shirt company using Java as a backend language, html, CSS and JavaScript on the front end and MySQL as database to store inventory data. An inventory management system has several critical components. At its core, inventory control works by tracking the two main functions of a warehouse: receiving (incoming) and shipping (outgoing). The user can manage i.e. insert, delete and update t-shirt inventory using webapp UI with ease.

Project Management Approach
We will be following the traditional approach to develop top to top inventory management system.  The following three factors include for our traditional management approach.
•	Scope: The act of specifying all project development steps, including what will and will not be done. Defining the scope of the project aids in keeping it under control.
•	Time: You can influence many aspects of a project, but you cannot influence time. It can be extremely difficult for a project manager to know how to use time efficiently, keep the project on track, and achieve all desired outcomes.
•	Cost: As early as possible, the project manager should define the project's budget. It should then be compared to what the customer or client initially presented.

Project Scope and advantages:

Inventory management is the practice of planning the purchase, storage, and sale of stock—whether raw materials, parts, or finished goods—to ensure that the right type and amount of stock is available without holding excess stock and tying up cash. Inventory management, when done correctly, saves businesses money. The primary purpose of inventory management is to ensure there is enough goods or materials to meet demand without creating overstock, or excess inventory.

Accurate inventory management is essential for running a profitable product business. Stock tracking on a regular basis can help to avoid stock errors and other issues. The following are the 

Advantages of effective inventory management:

•	Improved Inventory Accuracy: With good inventory management, you know what's in stock and order only what you need to meet demand.

•	Reduced Overselling Risk: Inventory management keeps track of what's in stock and what's on backorder, allowing you to avoid overselling products.

•	Savings on costs: Stock costs money until it is sold. Storage, handling, and transportation fees, as well as insurance and employee salaries, are all part of the carrying costs. Inventory is also vulnerable to theft, natural disaster loss, and obsolescence.

•	Avoiding Stockouts and Excess Stock: Better planning and management helps a business minimize the number of days, if any, that an item is out of stock and avoid carrying too much inventory. Learn more about solving for stockouts in our “Essential Guide to Inventory Control.”


•	Greater Insights: With inventory tracking and stock control, you can also easily spot sales trends or track recalled products or expiry dates.

•	Better Terms With Vendors and Suppliers: Inventory management also provides insights about which products sell and in what volume. Use that knowledge as leverage to negotiate better prices and terms with suppliers.

•	Increased Profits: A better understanding of both availability and demand leads to higher inventory turnover, which leads to greater profits.

•	A More Organized Warehouse: An efficient warehouse with items organized based on demand, which items are often sold together and other factors reduces labor costs and speeds order fulfillment.


Technologies Used

Front end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

Back end: Java, Spring Boot

Database: MySQL 


  
Software tools 

•	Intellij: IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment written in Java for developing computer software. It is developed by JetBrains and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition, and in a proprietary commercial edition. Both can be used for commercial development.

•	Apache Tomcat: Apache Tomcat is a free and open-source implementation of the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Expression Language, and WebSocket technologies. Tomcat provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java code can run.

•	ClickApp: ClickUp is a cloud-based collaboration and project management tool suitable for businesses of all sizes and industries. Features include communication and collaboration tools, task assignments and statuses, alerts and a task toolbar. 

•	Eclipse compiler : The Eclipse Java compiler is a component of the JDT Core component (JDT: Java Development Tool). When changes are detected, an incremental compiler compiles the code automatically. It does not compile all of the project's code. It compiles only the changes you've made (incrementally), allowing programmers to respond quickly. Javac, on the other hand, does not support incremental compilation. If Eclipse employs javac, programmers will notice a slow response time to changes they have made, reducing productivity. The Eclipse Java compiler requires JRE to run compiled byte code, so a JRE is sufficient to use the Eclipse IDE – a JDK is not required.
